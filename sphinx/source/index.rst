FI226: Magnetic trap
================================================

Simulation of the magnetic field generated by a anti-helmholtz coil done as a homework of FI226 (IFGW-Unicamp).

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Python scripts/modules:

   coil_utils
   coilSimulation_exact
   coilSimulation_real

coil_utils.py module is intended to calculates the magnetic field of
coils. The parameters of the function are illustrated in fig. 1 and 2 for an
arbitrary current loop and for anti-helmholtz coil, respectively.

coilSimulation_exact.py and coilSimulation_real.py simulates the
helmholtz coil given some parameters.
