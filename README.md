# FI226: Magnetic trap
Simulation of the magnetic field generated by a anti-helmholtz coil done as a homework of FI226 (IFGW-Unicamp).

> coil_utils.py module is intended to calculates the magnetic field of coils. The parameters of the function are illustrated in fig. 1 and 2 for an arbitrary current loop and for anti-helmholtz coil, respectively.

> coilSimulation_exact.py and coilSimulation_real.py simulates the helmholtz coil given some parameters.
